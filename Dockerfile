#
# README
# ------
#
# This is a Docker image of Ubuntu with Python 2.7, uwsgi, and nginx installed.
#
# This Dockerfile is structured to optimally use the Docker cache as much as possible without being inflexible. The
# general order of events is:
#
# 1. Install OS dependencies which do not change too much
# 2. Install application dependencies (e.g. Python requirements.txt)
# 3. Install the application code
# 4. Configure things that need to be configured (e.g. nginx)
#
# The service and configuration will be installed into /datawire/config and /datawire/<module>. If you modify <module>
# in your program source tree (e.g. rename 'hello' to 'foobar' then update config/uwsgi.ini to the new module name.
#
# ASK if you do not know the answer before blindly hacking up this file!
#

# Install System dependencies
#
# NOTE: build-essential and python-dev MUST BE installed because we need them for uwsgi which is a C source distribution
#       that needs to be built before use.
#
# NOTE: DO NOT remove the uwsgi install from below. It's better to let it be compiled and installed during the system
#       setup process because compilation is slow. If it's moved to requirements.txt then everytime a dependency is
#       modified uwsgi will be recompiled as well.
